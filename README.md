# removeStoryboard.sh ‚Äî Automate Removing Main.storyboard from Your Xcode Project

Welcome to **removeStoryboardDynamically.sh**, the clean, simple, and fully automated shell script to help you completely remove `Main.storyboard` from your Xcode project. This script also cleans up all related settings in your project files and sets up your `SceneDelegate.swift` for a fully programmatic UI launch.

Why Use removeStoryboard.sh?

- üíª **Save time and avoid errors**: Automates storyboard removal steps that are usually manual and error-prone.
- üóÇ **Cleans up related settings**: Removes entries from `Info.plist`, `project.pbxproj` build settings, and updates your app lifecycle code.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Ready for programmatic UI**: Configures `SceneDelegate.swift` for launching your UI without storyboard.
- üöÄ **Easy to use**: Works for any Xcode project, just give it the project name or run it interactively.
- üßπ **Safe and idempotent**: Contains checks to avoid errors if keys/files are already missing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode project
- Basic familiarity with terminal / shell scripting

### Usage

Clone or download this script **removeStoryboardDynamically.sh** into your project root folder. (parallel to your Xcode project)

Give execute permission to the script:

```bash
chmod +x removeStoryboardDynamically.sh
```

Run the script by passing your project name (without `.xcodeproj`):

```bash
./removeStoryboardDynamically.sh <MyProject>
```

Or run with no arguments to be prompted:

```bash
./removeStoryboardDynamically.sh
```

Enter your project name when asked, and let the script handle the rest!

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

1. **Storyboard Removal**  
   Deletes `Main.storyboard` from your project‚Äôs `Base.lproj` folder.

2. **Info.plist Cleaning**  
   Removes `UIMainStoryboardFile` and iOS 13 Scene Manifest keys to prevent storyboard loading.

3. **Build Settings Update**  
   Clears the storyboard key in your Xcode project‚Äôs build settings file (`project.pbxproj`).

4. **SceneDelegate Setup**  
   Replaces your `SceneDelegate.swift` with a clean template that launches your initial view controller programmatically.
